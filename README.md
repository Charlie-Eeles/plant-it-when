ðŸŒ± Simple, straightforward planting and harvesting calendars for common garden plants in the UK. ðŸŒ¾

I was getting into a bit of home gardening and while the information was out there, it was clunky to parse, I wanted a simple resource to answer "what can I plant _right now_".

I aggregated some information and served it through an API of mine, but I've since moved it to a JSON document in this repo.

I hope you find this convenient and good luck in your home gardening endeavours.
